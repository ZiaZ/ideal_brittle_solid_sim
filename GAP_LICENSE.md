### GAP suite — Non-commercial License Agreement

*Last updated: 19th April 2017*

The GAP suite of programs, comprising the GAP-filler and GAP packages
(together “the Software”), written by Dr Gabor Csanyi and Dr Albert
Bartok-Partay of the University of Cambridge (the “Authors”) for
describing the chemical environments of atoms and molecules and
predicting potential energy surfaces, is copyrighted by the University
of Cambridge and the Authors. Users at non-commercial institutions may
obtain a copy for Non-commercial Purposes. "Non-commercial Purposes" 
means use of the Software and/or any **Software-derived data (including
interatomic potentials)** for academic research or other not-for-profit
or scholarly purposes which are undertaken at an educational, 
non-profit, charitable or governmental institution that does not
involve the production or manufacture of products for sale or the 
performance of services for a fee or other non-monetary value.

For commercial use of either or both the Software or any
Software-derived data, please contact Cambridge Enterprise Limited at
<enquiries@enterprise.cam.ac.uk>.

    -   A. P. Bartok et al. *Physical Review B* **87** 184115 (2013)
    -   That this Software is available for non-commercial use from
